LESSON ONE
# 🚀 **Introduction to Deployment Pipelines**

### 🧭 What is a Deployment Pipeline?

A **deployment pipeline** (also known as a **CI/CD pipeline**) is an automated sequence of steps that takes your code from **development** to **production** — ensuring it’s built, tested, and deployed **quickly**, **reliably**, and **safely**.

Think of it as an **assembly line for software delivery** — each stage validates the code before it moves to the next.

---

## 🧱 **Core Stages of a Deployment Pipeline**

Each pipeline may vary slightly depending on the stack, but most share these key stages:

---

### **1️⃣ Source (Version Control Stage)**

* The pipeline begins when code is pushed or merged into a Git repository.
* This push event (on `main`, `dev`, or via pull request) **triggers** the CI/CD workflow.

🧩 **Tools:** GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

---

### **2️⃣ Build Stage**

* The source code is compiled or packaged into a deployable artifact (e.g., a `.jar`, `.zip`, or Docker image).
* This ensures that the application can run properly and that all dependencies are correctly installed.

🧩 **Examples:**

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
docker build -t myapp:latest .
```

🧩 **Tools:** GitHub Actions runners, Jenkins, AWS CodeBuild, Docker

---

### **3️⃣ Test Stage**

* Automated tests are executed to catch errors or regressions early.
* This includes:

  * **Unit tests** – test individual functions/components.
  * **Integration tests** – test interactions between modules.
  * **Static code analysis** – using tools like **ESLint** or **SonarQube**.

🧩 **If any test fails,** the pipeline stops immediately.

---

### **4️⃣ Deploy Stage**

Once the build and tests pass, the code is deployed to one or more environments:

* **Development / Staging** – for internal testing.
* **Production** – for end-users.

Deployments can happen to servers, containers, or cloud platforms.

🧩 **Tools:** AWS CodeDeploy, Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, Vercel, Netlify

---

### **5️⃣ Post-Deployment Stage**

After deployment, additional checks and tasks may occur:

* **Smoke testing** (confirm app is running)
* **Monitoring and alerts** (with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog)
* **Rollback automation** (in case deployment fails)
* **Notifications** (Slack, email, Teams)

---

## ⚙️ **Example: Basic Deployment Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-test-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Deploy to Production
        if: success()
        run: echo "Deploying to production..."
```

## 🧩 **Deployment Strategies**

Deployment strategy defines **how new versions of an application are released** to users.
Here are the most common ones:

---

### **1️⃣ Recreate Deployment**

* The old version is **stopped completely**, and the new version is **deployed**.
* Downtime occurs during the switch.

🧱 **Pros:** Simple to implement
⚠️ **Cons:** Causes downtime

---

### **2️⃣ Rolling Deployment**

* New versions are deployed gradually, **one instance at a time**, replacing old ones.
* Users experience a mix of old and new versions during rollout.

🧱 **Pros:** No downtime, safer
⚠️ **Cons:** Harder rollback if something goes wrong mid-rollout

---

### **3️⃣ Blue-Green Deployment**

* Two identical environments: **Blue (current production)** and **Green (new version)**.
* Once Green is fully tested, traffic is **switched instantly** from Blue to Green.
* Blue remains as backup for instant rollback.

🧱 **Pros:** Zero downtime, easy rollback
⚠️ **Cons:** Doubles infrastructure cost temporarily

---

### **4️⃣ Canary Deployment**

* The new version is rolled out to a **small subset of users** first.
* If metrics and logs look good, the rollout gradually expands to everyone.

🧱 **Pros:** Early feedback, minimal risk
⚠️ **Cons:** Requires monitoring setup and routing control

---

### **5️⃣ Shadow Deployment**

* The new version runs **in parallel** with the old one but **doesn’t serve live users yet**.
* Useful for testing real traffic safely.

🧱 **Pros:** Risk-free validation
⚠️ **Cons:** Requires duplicate infrastructure and monitoring logic

## 🎯 **Why Deployment Pipelines Matter**

| Benefit             | Description                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**           | Automates repetitive steps to release faster               |
| **Quality**         | Ensures code passes tests and linting                      |
| **Reliability**     | Reduces deployment errors via automation                   |
| **Rollback safety** | Makes it easier to revert bad deployments                  |
| **Confidence**      | Developers can push updates more frequently with less fear |

## 🧠 **In Short**

> A **deployment pipeline** automates every step from code commit to production release — combining build, test, and deployment stages — while **deployment strategies** determine *how* updates reach users (gradually, instantly, or safely).
